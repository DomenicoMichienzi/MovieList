### Web API project with ASP.NET Core

A small project following [this](https://www.manning.com/books/building-web-apis-with-asp-net-core) book to create a **Web API** project to learn the **ASP.NET Core** framework and things like **REST**, **GraphQL**, **gRPC**.
Dataset, a CSV file, on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies).
For space reasons the file has been reduced to 200k movies, from over 700k, taking only movies from 2016 to 2023.
For simplicity, SQLite was used as the Database, so it can be uploaded here on GitHub
